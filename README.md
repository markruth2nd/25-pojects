# 25-projects
25 projects challenge

This is a challenge I have assigned myself for practise where I will complete 25 projects as quick as I can, I am hoping to complete all 25 within 5-6 weeks. 

Challenge 1:
Purpose of challenge 1 is to use HTML, CSS & JavaScript to create a page where I can change the background colour of the page at the click of a button.
    In the HTML file I will only need to create 1 div within the body for the button to click. I will add a link to Bootstrap cdn for the button I will use.
    CSS will amend the size of the div on the page as well as the alignment of the button on the page.
    JS file will create the function which will change the background colour when I click the bootstrap button, screenshots below:
